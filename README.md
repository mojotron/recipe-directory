# Recipe Directory (Learning Lab)

This project in based on [Shaun | TheNetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/TheNetNinja) tutorial [Build Web Apps with React & Firebase](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-react-firebase/).
It is mesh of recipe directory and finance tracker with my additional features.
Goal of this project is practice and learn React, React Router, Testing Library and TDD approach. Most of the project is built before watching videos. I experimented on every part with my own implementation, if i couldn make it work i tried with official docuentation and if theent didin work i would watch Shauns implementation in video.
